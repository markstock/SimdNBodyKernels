# SimdNBodyKernels
Easy-to-implement n-body simulation kernels created using Intel's ispc and llvm/clang


This package contains several simple single-step programs for force summation 
using the direct O(N^2) n-body method, accelerated with both SIMD extensions
(SSE2, AVX) and multithreading using Intel's ispc compiler. These blocks of code
should be easy to incorporate into your own n-body simulation projects.
